# Lagrangian Subspace and Dual Pair Analysis over GF(3)

##  Description

The program performs the following steps:

1. **Vector Space Setup**:
   - Defines a 6-dimensional vector space over GF(3).
   - Introduces a symmetric bilinear form using a diagonal matrix.

2. **Isotropic (Lagrangian) Subspaces**:
   - Identifies all 3-dimensional subspaces where the bilinear form vanishes on all pairs of basis vectors.

3. **Dual Pairs**:
   - Finds pairs of isotropic subspaces with trivial intersection. Equivalently, the pairing between the Lagrangians in each dual is non-singular. 

4. **Determinant Vectors**:
   - For each subspace, computes determinants of all 3-column combinations of its basis matrix.
   - Forms a 20-dimensional vector from these determinants.

5. **Dot Product Evaluation**:
   - Uses a fixed 20-dimensional coefficient vector.
   - Computes dot products of determinant vectors with the coefficient vector.
   - Counts how many dual pairs yield zero dot products for both subspaces.


##  Output

- Total number of isotropic subspaces
- Total number of dual pairs 
- The coefficient vector used for dot product evaluation
- Number of dual pairs where both dot products are zero

This program was developed with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot, an AI system powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 architecture. The code and computations were carefully reviewed and subjected to routine correctness checks. The program itself constitutes a brute force search and verification of linear-algebraic properties of Lagrangian subspaces over a finite field.
